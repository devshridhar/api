## Security Measures

- **Helmet**: Secures HTTP headers to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Rate Limiting**: Restricts excessive requests to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **CORS Configuration**: Ensures secure cross-origin resource sharing.
- **CSRF Protection**: Guards against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection and XSS attacks.
